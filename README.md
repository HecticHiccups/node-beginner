##Eureka for Node!
So I've finally figured out the fundamentals of Node.js. <br>
After hours of Nail biting, and head banging I can now explain it to those who've been through it to.

##Getting Started!
So getting started with node is quite simple you will need 3 things regardless of your operating system.
- A text Editor e.g(Atom, brackets, sublime text)
- Download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)(npm as well, should come with Node when downloaded)
- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Once you've downloaded these things, you need to verify you have them by running version commands.<br>
git version <br>
node -v <br>
npm -v  <br>
